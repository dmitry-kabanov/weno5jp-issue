    """ Compute observed order of accuracy.

    Compute observed order of accuracy given `errors` and `resolutions`.
    First element in the result is necessarily 'nan' because order of accuracy
    is computed by comparing error in two different grids.

    Parameters
    ----------
    errors: array_like
        array_like of errors (or error norms)
    resolutions: array_like
        array_like of grid resolutions
    exclude : bool
        If True, then the first (NaN) value will be excluded from the returned
        value, otherwise the first value will stay there (for example, you need
        the first value when you format a convergence table). Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    orders: array_like
        array_like of orders, with first element being 'nan'
